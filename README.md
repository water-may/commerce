# Commerce Website Project

This repository contains the source code and assets for a basic e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to create an online platform for selling products and managing customer orders.

## Features:

- **Product Catalog**: A dynamic product catalog where administrators can add, edit, and delete products. Each product has a name, description, price, and an image.

- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout. The cart provides a summary of selected items and their total cost.

- **User Authentication**: A simple login system allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. Administrators can also manage user accounts.

- **Order Management**: Administrators can view and manage customer orders. They can track order status, update shipping details, and provide order confirmation.

- **Payment Gateway**: A basic payment gateway integration allows users to make secure online payments. The payment process is simulated, and actual transactions are not processed.

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience on various devices and screen sizes.

- **Search Functionality**: A search bar enables users to find products quickly by entering keywords.

- **Admin Panel**: An administrative panel provides access to manage products, orders, and user accounts.
